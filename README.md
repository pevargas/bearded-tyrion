I was looking for the least complicated wiki that could be dropped into a Tomcat and ran off of markdown files. Hopefully, this will be that project.

I needed my own personal wiki for work. At work, I have to use a Windows, so a tomcat was the most appropriate choice as that's the flavor of choice there.
